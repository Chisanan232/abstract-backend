# Why Abstract Backend Became Its Own Library

When I first added message queue support to the [`Chisanan232/slack-mcp-server`](https://github.com/Chisanan232/slack-mcp-server) project, it lived as a single helper tucked inside that repository. The job was simple: receive Slack webhook events, queue them, and let the rest of the system process them asynchronously. It worked well enough, but I quickly ran into the limits of keeping that logic embedded in one codebase.

## One Project, One Off

In the early days the queue consumer sat directly inside the Slack MCP server. Each time the service needed to talk to Redis I duplicated config helpers, re-implemented error handling, and kept the queue contracts tightly coupled to Slack-specific abstractions. It _felt_ like a minor compromiseâ€”until I began building another MCP service.

## Copy-Paste or Better Architecture?

While building [`Chisanan232/clickup-mcp-server`](https://github.com/Chisanan232/clickup-mcp-server), I faced the exact same webhook-to-queue flow. Copying the Slack implementation would have been fast but painful to maintain. Every bug fix, performance patch, or provider enhancement would require a multi-repo patch dance. That experience pushed me to rethink how backend components should be shared across projects.

## Designing for Pluggability

Instead of cloning code, I teased the queue logic into a reusable abstraction layer:

- **Protocol-first contracts** define the queue behaviours any provider must satisfy.
- **Dynamic discovery via entry points** means a simple `pip install` activates a new backend.
- **Symmetric uninstall** lets teams remove a provider with `pip uninstall` when it is no longer needed.
- **Application-facing helpers** keep consumer code stable even as the concrete backend changes.

With these pieces in place, switching from Redis to Kafka or an AWS-managed queue becomes a packaging decision, not an application rewrite.

## Centralising Backend Components

The extracted library, now this [`abstract-backend`](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abstract-backend) project, turned into a home for reusable backend behaviours:

- Shared logging utilities and types ensure consistent diagnostics.
- Contract tests validate that every provider honours the same guarantees.
- Documentation and examples show how to build new providers or adopt existing ones.

Most importantly, **every Python project in this ecosystem now speaks to the same protocols**. Teams can experiment with different providers without touching application workflows.

## Looking Ahead

Abstract Backend started as a humble helper function and grew into a modular architecture because I needed flexibility across multiple MCP services. The journey taught me that decoupling backend components into their own package keeps projects maintainable, encourages experimentation, and makes upgrades safer. I hope this story helps other developers avoid the copy-and-paste trap and embrace pluggable backends from day one.
