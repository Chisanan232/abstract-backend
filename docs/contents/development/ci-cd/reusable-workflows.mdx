# Reusable Workflows

The reusable workflow implementations that power this template now live in the centralized repository `Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python`. This project simply references those shared workflows so every child project inherits the same battle-tested automation.

## Overview

- **Centralized maintenance**: Build, test, release, documentation, and packaging logic is defined once in the reusable workflow repository.
- **Lightweight template**: Local workflow files stay minimal by calling the centralized definitions with `uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/<workflow>.yaml@ref`.
- **Config driven**: Behavior is customized through `intent.yaml` and workflow inputs rather than editing workflow logic.

## Using them in this template

- Reference the centralized workflows from `.github/workflows/*.yml` using an explicit ref such as `@main` or a released tag.
- Keep `intent.yaml` up to date; the centralized workflows read its values to decide which operations to run.
- Consult the linked documentation for advanced configuration, authentication details, and troubleshooting tips.
