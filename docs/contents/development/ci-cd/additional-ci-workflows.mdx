# Additional CI Workflows

This document covers the specialized CI workflows that support specific aspects of the Abstract Backend beyond the main continuous integration and release processes.

## Overview

The project includes several specialized CI workflows that handle documentation quality and maintenance:

- **üìö Documentation Build Check** - Validates documentation builds on PRs and branch changes
- **ü§ñ Documentation Auto-Approve & Auto-Merge** - Streamlined docs updates

---

## Documentation Build Check

[![Documentation Build Check](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abstract-backend/actions/workflows/docs-build-check.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abstract-backend/actions/workflows/docs-build-check.yaml)

The [`docs-build-check.yaml`](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abstract-backend/blob/master/.github/workflows/docs-build-check.yaml) workflow validates that documentation builds successfully whenever documentation-related files are modified.

**Triggers:**
- **Pull Requests**: Any PR that modifies documentation files
- **Push Events**: All branches except `master` (to avoid conflicts with the main documentation deployment workflow)
- **Path Monitoring**: Automatically detects changes to documentation content, configuration, and dependencies

**Purpose**: Ensures documentation builds successfully before merging changes, preventing broken documentation deployments.

**Key Features:**
- **Comprehensive Path Monitoring** - Watches all documentation-related files including content, configuration, dependencies, and assets
- **Fast Build Validation** - Uses optimized setup with shallow clones and dependency caching for quick feedback
- **Build Quality Checks** - Validates build output, critical files, and provides detailed build statistics
- **TypeScript Validation** - Runs type checking to catch configuration errors early
- **Concurrency Control** - Cancels in-progress runs for the same PR/branch to save resources
- **Detailed Reporting** - Provides comprehensive build summaries in GitHub Actions interface

**Build Process:**
1. **Environment Setup**: Node.js 22 + pnpm 10 (matching production deployment)
2. **Dependency Installation**: Uses frozen lockfile for consistency
3. **Type Checking**: Validates TypeScript configuration and content
4. **Documentation Build**: Executes full Docusaurus build process
5. **Quality Validation**: Checks build artifacts and critical files
6. **Build Reporting**: Provides detailed statistics and status summary

**Path Coverage:**
- CI workflow configurations (`.github/workflows/docs-build-check.yaml`, `documentation.yaml`)
- Dependencies (`package.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`)
- Configuration files (`docusaurus.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`)
- Content files (`.md`, `.mdx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.js`, `.jsx`, `.css`)
- Versioned content and sidebars
- Static assets and source files

**Safety Mechanisms:**
- Prevents conflicts with main documentation deployment workflow
- Uses frozen lockfile installation for reproducible builds
- Validates critical files existence (index.html, 404.html)
- Provides warnings for potential build issues
- Includes comprehensive error reporting and debugging information

## Documentation Auto-Approve & Auto-Merge

[![Docs-only auto-approve & automerge](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abstract-backend/actions/workflows/docs-automerge.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/abstract-backend/actions/workflows/docs-automerge.yml)

The `docs-automerge.yml` workflow automatically approves and merges pull requests that only contain documentation changes. This streamlines the process for documentation updates.

**Triggers:**
- **Pull requests to master**: For PRs containing only documentation changes
- **PR events**: `opened`, `reopened`, `synchronize`, `ready_for_review`

**Purpose**: Accelerates documentation updates by automating approval and merge for docs-only changes.

**Key Features:**
- Intelligent detection of documentation-only changes
- Automated approval and merge for qualifying PRs
- Safety checks to ensure only documentation files are modified
- Streamlined workflow for maintaining up-to-date documentation

**Safety Mechanisms:**
- Validates that PR contains only documentation file changes
- Requires all status checks to pass before auto-merge
- Maintains audit trail of automated actions

## Workflow Integration

These additional CI workflows integrate with the main CI/CD system:

### **Integration Points:**
- **Documentation Build Check** ‚Üí Validates docs builds on PRs to prevent broken deployments
- **Docs Auto-merge** ‚Üí Accelerates documentation maintenance

### **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
- All workflows include status badges for easy monitoring
- Failed workflows trigger notifications for immediate attention
- Regular review ensures workflows stay aligned with project needs
