# Project Structure & Organization

This page explains the default layout provided by the Python UV Project Template so you can quickly understand where to place code, configuration, and automation for your own project.

## High-Level Layout

```
project/
├── src/                       # Application/library source code
│   └── your_package/          # Rename this to your real package name
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── types.py           # Example for PEP 561 type distribution
│       └── py.typed           # Marker enabling downstream type checking
├── test/                      # Pytest-based test suites
│   ├── unit_test/
│   └── integration_test/
├── docs_with_docusarus/       # Primary documentation (Docusaurus)
├── docs_with_mkdocs/          # Optional MkDocs documentation
├── scripts/                   # Helper scripts used by workflows
├── .github/workflows/         # GitHub Actions automation
├── pyproject.toml             # Project + tooling configuration
└── uv.lock                    # Locked dependency graph managed by uv
```

> **Tip:** Everything under `src/` is packaged and exported when you publish to PyPI. Everything else supports local development, automation, and documentation.

## Source Code (`src/`)

- Designed for the **src-layout** recommended by modern Python packaging.
- Ships with a minimal `types.py` + `py.typed` combo showing how to distribute type information.
- Rename the default package directory to match your project name and add modules as needed.
- Configure exports via `__init__.py` (or expose a public API) based on your needs.

### Type Distribution Example

The template demonstrates PEP 561 support out of the box:

```python title="src/your_package/types.py"
type UserId = str
type Payload = dict[str, str | int | float | bool | None]

__all__ = ["UserId", "Payload"]
```

Add additional aliases or Protocols here and keep `py.typed` in the same package so type checkers pick them up automatically.

## Testing (`test/`)

- Pytest folders split into `unit_test/` and `integration_test/` for clarity.
- Extend with more directories (e.g., `contract_test/`, `e2e_test/`) if your project requires broader coverage.
- Use the provided pytest plugins (coverage, asyncio, reruns) via `pyproject.toml` dependencies.
- Tests are picked up automatically by `ci.yaml` and `ci_includes_e2e_test.yaml` workflows.

## Automation (`.github/workflows/`)

Key workflows shipped with the template:

- **`ci.yaml`** – Standard matrix CI (Python versions, OS variants, linting, tests).
- **`ci_includes_e2e_test.yaml`** – Optional CI variant that demonstrates how to add E2E jobs.
- **`release.yml`** – Intent-driven release process (Python package + Docker + docs).
- **`release-validate.yml`** / **`release-staging.yml`** – Validation/staging runs before production release.
- **`documentation.yaml`** – Builds and publishes Docusaurus site.
- **`type-check.yml`** – PEP 561 type distribution verification using the template’s `src/` package.
- **Supporting workflows** – Docker CI, docs auto-merge, docs build check, etc.

Use these as blueprints; remove what you do not need or extend them for your environment.

## Documentation (`docs_with_docusarus/` and `docs_with_mkdocs/`)

- Docusaurus site is the primary documentation experience with versioning, search, and blog examples.
- MkDocs project is included for teams that prefer a Markdown-first experience without React components.
- Both stacks share the same content philosophy—update whichever matches your needs and disable the other if unnecessary.

## Scripts (`scripts/`)

- Holds helper tooling used by CI (e.g., release utilities, documentation helpers).
- Keep reusable automation snippets here so they can be invoked locally and by workflows.

## Tooling Configuration

- **`pyproject.toml`** centralizes dependency groups (development, pre-commit) and configures pytest, coverage, pylint, mypy, etc.
- **`uv.lock`** records exact dependency versions resolved by uv; check it in for reproducible builds.
- Pre-commit hooks are declared in `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and reference the same virtual environment produced by uv.

## Extending the Template

- **Add packages** – Create new modules under `src/your_package/` and expose them in `__init__.py`.
- **Add CLI entry points** – Configure `[project.scripts]` or `tool.hatch` sections in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Add services** – Introduce FastAPI, Click, or other frameworks and wire tests/workflows accordingly.
- **Add pipelines** – Duplicate existing GitHub workflows or call out to reusable workflows in other repos.

Keeping this structure consistent makes it easier to upgrade the template, onboard contributors, and reuse automation across multiple projects.
