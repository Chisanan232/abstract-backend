# Project Structure & Organization

Abstract Backend ships as an installable library plus a fully-documented reference implementation. This page reflects the current repository layout so you can navigate production code, tests, and docs with confidence.

## High-Level Layout

## `abe/` package

- **`abe/backends/message_queue/`** features the production message-queue abstraction. It includes the `MessageQueueBackend` protocol in `abe/backends/message_queue/base/protocol.py`, the runtime consumer in `abe/backends/message_queue/consumer.py`, the dynamic loader in `abe/backends/message_queue/loader.py`, and the development-only `MemoryBackend` under `abe/backends/message_queue/service/memory.py`.
- **`abe/logging/`** exposes structured logging support through `abe/logging/settings.py` (the `LoggingConfig` dataclass) and `abe/logging/utils.py` (setup helpers, logger controls, and path utilities).
- **`abe/types.py`** exports JSON aliases, handler protocols, and the `MessageQueueBackendProtocol`. The file is included in `py.typed` so downstream projects receive type information.
- **`abe/__init__.py`** wires the public API, re-exporting critical types and helpers for package consumers.

## Documentation (`docs/`)

- **`docs/contents/`** holds authored Markdown/MDX for architecture guides, quick starts, API references, and contributor docs.
- **`docs/src/`** contains Docusaurus React components, CSS, and layout customisations (for example `docs/src/components/HomepageFeatures/index.tsx`).
- **`docs/static/`** stores images and static assets referenced by the site.
- Docusaurus configuration, sidebars, and versioning live alongside the content; `package.json` scripts run the docs locally or in CI.

## Examples (`examples/`)

- **`examples/type_checking/`** illustrates the Protocols from `abe/types.py`, showing how to implement handlers and message-queue backends that satisfy the exported contracts.

## Tests (`test/`)

- **`test/unit_test/`** covers granular behaviour, including message-queue consumers (`test/unit_test/backends/queue/test_consumer.py`) and logging utilities.
- **`test/integration_test/`** exercises end-to-end flows within a single process, such as logging configuration scenarios.
- **`test/contract_test/`** codifies provider expectations—for example, `test/contract_test/backends/queue/base/test_queue_backend_contract.py` validates compliance with `MessageQueueBackendProtocol`.
- **`test/e2e_test/`** is reserved for whole-system validations that replicate production flows when applicable.

## Automation & Tooling

- **`.github/workflows/`** defines CI pipelines (type checking, docs previews, release orchestration) and reusable workflow definitions consumed across repositories.
- **`scripts/ci/verify_type_checking.sh`** enforces that `abe/types.py` exports the expected aliases and protocols; other scripts under `scripts/docker/` and `scripts/ci/` support repeatable local and CI tasks.
- **Root configuration** files include `pyproject.toml`, `mypy.ini`, `.pylintrc`, `.coveragerc`, `pytest.ini`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, and `codecov.yml`, ensuring consistent tooling across contributors.

## Auxiliary Artifacts

- Additional metadata such as `LICENSE`, `README.md`, and `sonar-project.properties` live at the repository root for discoverability.

Maintaining this organisation keeps production modules (`abe/`), developer documentation (`docs/`), and quality gates (`test/`, `scripts/`, `.github/`) in sync. When you introduce new backends, utilities, or docs, mirror the existing patterns so they remain easy to discover and integrate into automation.
