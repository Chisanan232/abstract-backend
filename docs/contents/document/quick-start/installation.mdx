# Installing Abstract Backend and Providers

Use this guide to install the core library, layer in provider packages, and verify that entry-point discovery works end-to-end.

## Step 1 · Install the core package

Pick the workflow that matches your dependency manager.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="pip" label="pip" default>

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install abstract-backend
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="uv" label="uv">

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install abstract-backend
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="poetry" label="Poetry">

```bash
poetry add abstract-backend
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

At this point you have access to the shared abstractions: `QueueBackend`, `EventConsumer`, the plugin loader, and the in-memory `MemoryBackend` fallback.

## Step 2 · Install one or more providers

Providers are distributed as normal Python packages that register the `abe.backends.queue` entry point group. Install as many as you need:

```bash
pip install abe-backend-memory              # ships with the repo (development only)
pip install abe-backend-redis              # example third-party provider
pip install abe-backend-sqs                # another provider
```

Replace the package names with the providers published by your organization. Providers must expose a `from_env()` class method that creates the backend instance.

## Step 3 · Select a provider at runtime

Abstract Backend chooses the first non-memory provider it finds unless you override it. Set the `QUEUE_BACKEND` environment variable to pick a specific implementation:

```bash
export QUEUE_BACKEND=redis   # macOS/Linux
set QUEUE_BACKEND=redis      # Windows (cmd)
$env:QUEUE_BACKEND="redis"   # Windows (PowerShell)
```

Skip this step to accept the auto-selection behavior (or fall back to the memory backend when no providers are installed).

## Step 4 · Verify discovery

Run this snippet after installation to make sure your provider can be resolved:

```python
from abe.backends.queue.loader import load_backend

backend = load_backend()
print(type(backend).__name__)
```

You should see the class name of the provider you installed (for example `RedisBackend`). If the memory fallback loads instead, double-check the environment variable and that the provider package exposes the entry point.

## Optional · Installing straight from source

If you are contributing to the library itself, clone the repository and install it in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chisanan232/abstract-backend.git
cd abstract-backend
pip install -e .[dev]
```

Editable installs keep your working tree and installed package in sync while you experiment.

Move on to [How to Run](./how-to-run.mdx) to wire the loader and consumer into your application.
