# Getting Started with Abstract Backend

Abstract Backend lets you bind your application to a stable interface while discovering real backend implementations at runtime. This quick start walks through installing the core library, wiring a provider, and running your first consumer.

## What you'll learn

- Install the core `abstract-backend` package
- Add a backend provider distributed via Python entry points
- Configure environment variables (or defaults) to select the provider
- Publish and consume messages using the shared interfaces

## Recommended path

Follow these pages in order:

- [Requirements](./requirements.mdx) – Supported Python versions and tooling you need
- [Installation](./installation.mdx) – Install the core package and a backend provider
- [How to Run](./how-to-run.mdx) – Wire the loader and consumer into an application

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore the [Architecture Overview](/dev/next/architecture) to understand how providers plug into the system.
