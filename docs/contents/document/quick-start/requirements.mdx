# Requirements

Whether you want to consume a backend that already exists or publish a new backend implementation, have the following prerequisites ready before you start.

## Runtime prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.12, 3.13, or 3.14. The library ships with type information that targets these versions.
- **pip** (or another PEP 517 installer): Needed to install `abstract-backend` and any backend provider distributions.
- **Operating systems**: Linux, macOS, and Windows are all supported. The reference memory backend uses `asyncio` only and has no native extensions.

## Recommended tooling for development

- **uv** or **pipx**: Useful for managing isolated environments. The project itself is authored with uv, but any virtual environment tool works for consumers.
- **Git** ≥ 2.20: Required if you plan to work with the repository or contribute new providers.
- **An async-friendly IDE**: VS Code, PyCharm, or another editor with asyncio and type-checking support makes protocol development easier.

## Provider-specific considerations

Each backend provider may require extra system packages (for example, Redis client libraries). Consult the provider’s documentation after installation.

Abstract Backend expects providers to expose a `from_env()` factory method. Prepare any environment variables or configuration files that your chosen provider documents (for example `REDIS_URL` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`).

## Optional extras

- **Node.js 18+**: Only needed if you plan to build this documentation site locally.

## Verify your setup

```bash
python --version
pip --version

# optional but recommended
uv --version
git --version
```

If these commands run without errors, you are ready to install `abstract-backend` and proceed to the [Installation](./installation.mdx) guide.
