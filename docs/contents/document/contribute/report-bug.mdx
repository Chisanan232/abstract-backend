## Example Bug Report

```
Title: Memory backend loses messages when consumer restarts

Environment:
- OS: macOS 14.5
- Python: 3.11.8
- Abstract Backend: 0.5.0
- Installed via `uv pip install .`

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Start the development server using `uv run abe-dev-server`
2. Configure `MemoryBackend` as the default queue backend
3. Publish five test messages to the `notifications` topic
4. Restart the `AsyncLoopConsumer` while messages are in flight

Expected Behavior:
All five messages should be processed after the consumer restarts.

Actual Behavior:
Only the first two messages are processed; the remaining three are dropped without errors.

Additional Information:
Setting `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG` shows "Consumer restarted" in the logs, but no warnings about discarded messages.
```

After you've submitted a bug report:

- Be responsive to questions about the issue
- Provide additional information if requested
- Consider helping test the fix when it becomes available

Thank you for helping improve Abstract Backend!
