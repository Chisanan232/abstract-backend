# Python UV Project Template

Welcome to the **Python UV Project Template** - a modern, production-ready template for Python projects that leverages the power of [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package management and industry best practices.

## What is This Template?

This template provides a comprehensive foundation for Python projects, designed to eliminate the repetitive setup work that developers face when starting new projects. Instead of spending hours configuring tools, setting up CI/CD pipelines, and establishing project structure, you can focus immediately on building your application.

## The Problem It Solves

Starting a new Python project often involves:

- 🔧 **Setting up package management** (pip, poetry, or uv)
- 📁 **Creating proper project structure** with src layout
- 🧪 **Configuring testing frameworks** (pytest, coverage)
- ✅ **Setting up code quality tools** (black, pylint, mypy)
- 🔄 **Establishing CI/CD workflows** for automation
- 📚 **Creating documentation structure**
- 🐳 **Adding containerization support**
- ⚡ **Configuring pre-commit hooks**

This template eliminates all of these setup tasks, providing you with a battle-tested foundation that follows Python community best practices.

## Why Choose This Template?

### ⚡ Lightning-Fast Package Management with uv

Built around [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), the fastest Python package manager:

- **10-100x faster** than pip and poetry for dependency resolution
- **Deterministic builds** with reliable lock files
- **Cross-platform compatibility** (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- **Drop-in replacement** for existing pip workflows

### 🛠️ Complete Development Toolkit

Pre-configured with essential development tools:

```bash
# Testing & Coverage
pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio, pytest-rerunfailures

# Code Quality
black (formatting), pylint (linting), mypy (type checking)

# Development Workflow
pre-commit hooks, GitHub Actions CI/CD
```

### 📦 Modern Project Structure

Follows Python packaging best practices:

```
project/
├── src/                    # Source code (src layout)
├── test/                   # Test suites
│   ├── unit_test/         # Unit tests
│   └── integration_test/  # Integration tests
├── docs_with_docusarus/   # Documentation (Docusaurus)
├── docs_with_mkdocs/      # Alternative docs (MkDocs)
├── .github/workflows/     # CI/CD automation
├── pyproject.toml         # Project configuration
└── uv.lock               # Dependency lock file
```

### 🚀 Production-Ready Features

- **Automated Testing**: Multi-Python version testing (3.12-3.14)
- **Code Quality Gates**: Automatic formatting, linting, and type checking
- **Security Scanning**: Built-in security checks and dependency updates
- **Release Automation**: Automated versioning and PyPI publishing
- **Documentation**: Both Docusaurus and MkDocs options
- **Containerization**: Docker support for deployment

## Who Should Use This Template?
