# API References

Use this section as the authoritative catalogue of the Abstract Backend APIs. Each page documents the contracts you target in your own code and the hooks providers must implement.

## Core interfaces

- [`QueueBackend` protocol](./queue-backend.mdx) – Async contract every provider implements.
- [`EventConsumer` & helpers](./event-consumer.mdx) – Standard consumption loop and lifecycle management.
- [`load_backend()` loader](./loader.mdx) – Entry-point discovery rules and configuration.
- [Shared types](./types.mdx) – Type aliases exported from `abe/types.py` for payloads and handler signatures.

## Provider utilities

- [`MemoryBackend`](./memory-backend.mdx) – Development fallback shipped with the library and its limitations.
- [`LoggingConfig` helpers](./logging.mdx) – Optional utilities for providers that want consistent logging behaviour.

Every reference page includes:

- Function and method signatures with type hints.
- Expected behaviour and error handling.
- Configuration/environment variables recognised by the component.
- Examples for both application developers and provider authors.

If you are building a new provider, read all core interface pages first; if you are consuming the library, focus on the loader and consumer docs.
